    <i>[Verse 1: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
    I'm at war with the world and they
    Try to pull me into the dark
    I struggle to find my faith
    As I'm slippin' from your arms
    It's getting harder to stay awake
    And my strength is fading fast
    You breathe into me at last
    
    <i>[Chorus: John Cooper, John Cooper & Jen Ledger, Jen Ledger]</i>
    I'm awake, I'm alive
    Now I know what I believe inside
    Now it's my time
    I'll do what I want, 'cause this is my life
    Here (Right here), right now (Right now)
    Stand my ground and never back down
    I know what I believe inside
    I'm awake and I'm alive
    
    <i>[Verse 2: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
    I'm at war with the world, 'cause I
    Ain't never gonna sell my soul
    I've already made up my mind
    No matter what, I can't be bought or sold
    When my faith is getting weak
    And I feel like giving in
    You breathe into me again

    <i>[Chorus: John Cooper, John Cooper & Jen Ledger, Jen Ledger]</i>
    I'm awake, I'm alive
    Now I know what I believe inside
    Now it's my time
    I'll do what I want, 'cause this is my life
    Here (Right here), right now (Right now)
    Stand my ground and never back down
    I know what I believe inside
    I'm awake and I'm alive
    
    <i>[Post-Chorus: John Cooper]</i>
    Waking up, waking up
    Waking up, waking up
    Waking up, waking up
    Waking up, waking up
    
    <i>[Bridge: John Cooper, John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
    In the dark
    I can feel you in my sleep
    In your arms, I feel you breathe into me
    Forever hold this heart that I will give to you
    Forever, I will live for you
    
    <i>[Guitar Solo]</i>

    <i>[Chorus: John Cooper, John Cooper & Jen Ledger, Jen Ledger]</i>
I'm awake, I'm alive
Now I know what I believe inside
Now it's my time
I'll do what I want, 'cause this is my life
Here (Right here), right now (Right now)
Stand my ground and never back down
I know what I believe inside
I'm awake and I'm alive

(I can't) Recognize me anymore
(This is all too hard to say)
(I am) I'm becoming sick and sore
(Why do I push you away?)
Just like I did before
Keep falling down when I try to soar
It's like I like the pain
I don't wanna feel this way

<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i>
What's happening to me?

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I, I'm slowly getting numb
I hate what I've become
Am I lost forever?
Bring me back to life
Help, my body's getting cold
So far away from home
But you feel like heaven
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
(You can) You can make me real again
(Just a plastic mannequin)
(I am) I am nothing but pretend
(But you know what I am)
Watch out 'cause this may sting (May sting)
Keep making promises I can't keep (Can't keep)
Help me to break these chains (These chains)
I don't wanna feel this way

<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i>
What's happening to me?

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I, I'm slowly getting numb
I hate what I've become

Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

I'm digging in the dirt
This is hell on Earth
Can you heal the places that I hurt?
Can't open up my eyes
All I see is black
Bring me back to life

What's happening to me?

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I, I'm slowly getting numb
I hate what I've become
Am I lost forever?

Bring me back to life
I, I'm slowly getting numb
I hate what I've become
Am I lost forever?

Hope still alive, it calls in the night

Rise up, rise up just like a fighter
Rise up, rise up

No way, never gonna bow to your hate
You can't pull me under
Stand proud, say it like you mean it
Shout out with voices like thunder

<i>[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper, Jen Ledger & Both]</i>
Slap in the face, you put me away
I'll stay in the game, I'll finish the race
Giving my all, my heart and my soul
You can't control
Love's gonna be a battle cry
So hear me

Rise up, rise up just like a fighter
We will rise again
Rise up, rise up, we got the fire
Burnin' to the end
No fear, no death tonight
I'm feelin' so alive
Rise up, rise up, we got the fire
We will rise (Rise), we will rise again

<i>[Refrain: John Cooper]</i>
Rise up, rise up (Rise up), we got the fire
Rise up, rise up (Rise up), we got the fire

Day, night, the pendulum is swinging
Left, right, our fate gets closer
Stand now, the enemy is knockin'
Scream out with voices like thunder

<i>[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper, Jen Ledger & Both]</i>
'Cause I believe we are the free
I know who I am, can't take it to me
I will defend, never pretend
I won't give in
Love's gonna be a battle cry
So we will

If you're sick, if you're sick, if you're sick
If you're sick of it
If you're sick, if you're sick, if you're sick
If you're sick of it!

<i>[Verse 1]</i>
When everything you do
Don't seem to matter
You try but it's no use
Your world is getting blacker
When every time you fail
Has no answer
Every empty promise made
Is a reminder

<i>[Pre-Chorus 1]</i>
No one can make this better
Take control, it's now or never!

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Are you sick of it?
Raise your hands
Get rid of it!
While there's a fighting chance
Are you over it?
Bored to death?
Have you had enough regret?
Take a stand, raise your hands

Every single day
I chase my own tail
Like a rat inside a maze
Got to get, got to get, get away
I'm running out of time

I'm never going to make it

(Who's gonna break these chains and lies?)
Love is the answer
I gotta speak it, believe it, that's how I feel inside
I, I, can't, can't sit here quiet

<i>[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]</i>
You can take my heart, you can take my breath
When you pry it from my cold, dead chest

<i>[Chorus: John Cooper]</i>
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us
<i>[Verse 2: John Cooper]</i>
(Hey) Can you hear me? (Hey) Are you listening?
Sleeping in the shadows, could be making history
(Walk) through the fire, (Walk) on the water
Used to be a slave, but now you are a conqueror

<i>[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]</i>
They can take my heart, they can take my breath
When they pry it from my cold, dead chest

<i>[Chorus: John Cooper]</i>
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

<i>[Bridge: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
The voice of the unheard
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
Rising up, up, up, up, up
We're rising up, up, up, up, up
Love is the answer
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us
<i>[Chorus: John Cooper]</i>
This is how we rise up
Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train
This is how we rise up
Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder
Magic, static, call me a fanatic
It's our world, they can never have it
This is how we rise up
It's our resistance, you can't resist us

    <i>[Verse 1: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
Target on my back
Lone survivor lasts
They got me in their sights
No surrender, no
Trigger fingers go
Living the dangerous life
Hey, hey, hey
Everyday when I wake
I'm trying to get up, they're knocking me down
Chewing me up, spitting me out
Hey, hey, hey
When I need to be saved
You're making me strong, you're making me stand
Never will fall, never will end

<i>[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]</i>
Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

<i>[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
You make me feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song, raise it up
Like the roar of victory in a stadium
Who can touch me cause I'm
I'm made of fire
Who can stop me tonight
I'm hard wired
You make me feel invincible

<i>[Post-Chorus: John Cooper]</i>
I feel, I feel it
Invincible
I feel, I feel it
Invincible

<i>[Verse 2: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
Here we go again
I will not give in
I've got a reason to fight
Every day we choose
We might win or lose
This is the dangerous life
Hey, hey, hey
Everyday when I wake
They say that I'm gone; they say that they've won
The bell has been rung, it's over and done
Hey, hey, hey
When I need to be saved
They counting me out, but this is my round
You in my corner, look at me now

<i>[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]</i>
Shot like a rocket up into the sky
Nothing can stop me tonight

<i>[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
You make me feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave
You're my titanium
Fight song, raise it up
Like the roar of victory in a stadium
Who can touch me cause I'm
I'm made of fire
Who can stop me tonight
I'm hard wired
You make me feel invincible

I feel, I feel it
Invincible

Feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful

Fight song, raise it up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium (Invincible)
So feel invincible
Earthquake, powerful
Just like a tidal wave
You make me brave (Invincible)
You're my titanium
Fight song, raise it up
Like a roar of victory in a stadium

    <i>[Verse 1: John Cooper]</i>
Death surrounds
My heartbeat’s slowing down
I won’t take this world’s abuse
I won’t give up, I refuse
This is how it feels when you’re bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity’s stolen
When everything you love is leaving
You hold on to what you believe in

<i>[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]</i>
The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

<i>[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

<i>[Verse 2: John Cooper]</i>
Break their hold
Because I won’t be controlled
They can’t keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me I push harder
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger

<i>[Pre-Chorus: Jen Ledger]</i>
The last thing I heard was you whispering goodbye
And then I heard you flatline

<i>[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

<i>[Bridge: John Cooper]</i>
Don’t you give up on me
You’re everything I need
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back

<i>[Guitar Solo: Seth Morrison]

[Chorus: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna stand and fight forever
Don’t close your eyes
No, not gonna die tonight
We're gonna fight for us together
No, we’re not gonna die tonight

<i>[Ending: John Cooper & Jen Ledger]</i>
No, we're not gonna die tonight
Not gonna die
Not gonna die
Not gonna die
Not gonna die
Not gonna die tonight

    <i>[Verse 1]</i>
Good evening, my people up in the chandeliers
The wining and dining, the menu is blood, sweat and tears
Everybody ready, raining down confetti
Champions are born right now
Ain't about the glamour, click goes the hammer
Run when you hear that sound

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
We know we survive
Even if we crawl to the finish line
I won't believe it, underdog dreamin'
Don't need no cheers, world's gonna see it
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Their dreams just keep dripping out of their golden cups
I'm starting, I'm starving, leftovers ain't enough
Ain't about the royals, they do nothing for ya
All you got is you right now
Who is gonna falter? Who is gonna conquer?
Better never count me out

<i>[Chorus]</i>
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
We know we survive
Even if we crawl to the finish line
I won't believe it, underdog dreamin'
Don't need no cheers, world's gonna see it
Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line

<i>[Bridge]</i>
Gonna make, gonna make
Gonna make it to the finish line
Every day, every day
Gonna make it to the finish line
Gonna make, gonna make
Gonna make it to the finish line
Every day, every day
Gonna make it to the finish line

Heroes never die
Gonna make it to the finish line
We know we survive
Even if we crawl to the finish line
I won't believe it, underdog dreamin'

    <i>[Verse 1]</i>
The walls between (The walls between)
You and I (You and I)
Always pushing us apart, nothing left but scars, fight after fight
The space between (The space between)
Our calm and rage (Rage)
Started growing shorter, disappearing slowly day after day

<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i>
I was sitting there waiting in my room for you
You were waiting for me too
And it makes me wonder

<i>[Chorus]</i>
The older I get
Will I get over it?
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I didn't know then it would hurt like this, but I think
The older I get
Maybe I'll get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
The time between (The time between)
Those cutting words (Words)
Built up our defenses, never made no sense, it just made me hurt
Do you believe (Do you believe?)
That time heals all wounds? (All wounds)
It started getting better, but it's easy not to fight when I'm not with you (You)

<i>[Pre-Chorus]</i>
I was sitting there waiting in my room for you
You were waiting for me too
And it makes me wonder

<i>[Chorus]</i>
The older I get
Will I get over it?
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I didn't know then it would hurt like this, but I think
The older I get
Maybe I'll get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this

<i>[Bridge]</i>
What was I waiting for? (What was I waiting more)
I should've taken less and given you more
I should've weathered the storm
I need to say so bad
What were you waiting for? (What were you waiting for?)
This could have been the best we ever had
(Oh!)

<i>[Chorus]</i>
The older I get
Will I get over it?
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I didn't know then it would hurt like this, but I think
The older I get
Maybe I'll get over it
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this!
Hurts like this!

<i>[Outro]</i>
I'm just getting older
I'm not getting over you
I'm trying to
Wish it didn't hurt like this
It's been way too long for the times we missed
I can't believe it still hurts like this

    <i>[Verse 1]</i>
The secret side of me, I never let you see
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
So stay away from me, the beast is ugly
I feel the rage, and I just can't hold it
It's scratching on the walls, in the closet, in the halls
It comes awake, and I can't control it
Hiding under the bed, in my body, in my head
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become
The nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster

<i>[Post-Chorus]</i>
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
My secret side I keep, hid under lock and key
I keep it caged, but I can't control it
'Cause if I let him out, he'll tear me up, break me down
Why won't somebody come and save me from this? Make it end

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become

I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster

<i>[Post-Chorus]</i>
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

<i>[Bridge]</i>
It's hiding in the dark, its teeth are razor-sharp
There's no escape for me, it wants my soul, it wants my heart
No one can hear me scream, maybe it's just a dream
Maybe it's inside of me, stop this monster

<i>[Chorus]</i>
I feel it deep within, it's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I hate what I've become
The nightmare's just begun
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I’m gonna lose control
It’s something radical
I must confess that I feel like a monster

I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster
I, I feel like a monster

Angry words and honking cars
Satellites and falling stars
Distant dark blue radios that whisper down my boulevards
Ghosts and chains rattle in the attic
Broken headphones filled with static
Lonely room you’ve got nowhere to run
Three, two
One for all and all for one

<i>[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]</i>
Times will be bad, times will be good
Things I wish I hadn’t done and some I wish I would
Cutting through the American noise
You’ve got a voice and a song to sing (And a song to sing)
Drink deep in the morning
Drink deep in the morning
See what the day will bring

<i>[Chorus: John Cooper]</i>
La da da da
Lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise
La da da da
Lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise

<i>[Verse 2: John Cooper]</i>
Slamming doors and cell phone rings
Hurricane force of silent screams
Don’t know what to believe
Bend the rule just to break it
You're so tired because you've got to fake it
But you just want to be someone
Three, two
One for all and all for one

<i>[Pre-Chorus: John Cooper]</i>

Why don’t you use it?

I left a dozen roses on your grave today
I'm in the grass on my knees, wipe the leaves away
I just came to talk for a while
Got some things I need to say

Now that it's over
I just want to hold her
I'd give up all the world to see

Now that it's over

And I can't live with myself today

<i>[Verse 2]</i>
Hey Lucy, I remembered your birthday
They said it'd bring some closure to say your name
I know I'd do it all different if I had the chance
But all I got are these roses to give
And they can't help me make amends!

Now that it's over
I just want to hold her
I'd give up all the world to see

Now that it's over

And I can't live with myself today

Here we are, now you're in my arms
I never wanted anything so bad
Here we are, for a brand new start
Livin' the life that we could've had
Me and Lucy walkin' hand in hand
Me and Lucy never want to end
Just another moment in your eyes
I'll see you in another life
In Heaven!
Where we never say goodbye!

I've got to live with the choices I've made
And I can't live with myself...
